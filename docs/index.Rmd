# **Introduction**

Coral reefs are integral ecosystems, each with their own set of diverse and endemic organisms. The coral reefs of the Virgin Islands vary in size and depth extending down to the mesophotic range, aprroximately 30 to 150m. These shallow and mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) are exposed to annual, seasonal, and dirunal variations in oceanographic variables (temperature, salinity, nutrients etc). This thesis will explore and characterize the oceanographic changes on the reefs, as well as investigate the effects from offshore internal waves.


## **Section 1 - Site Characterization**
There are several sites across the US Virgin Islands used in this study. These sites were chosen from those used in the Territorial Coral Reef Monitoring Project (TCRMP), with data coming from annual deployments of HOBO Pro V2 Water Temperature Loggers. Missing data gaps were filled using data from NPS deployments at the same site (Reference better).

Latitude: 18.3445  
Longitude: -64.98595  
Depth: 9 meters  

Characterization: Black Point is a shallow orbicellid reef located just offshore from UVI St. Thomas. Temperature monitoring at this site has occured annually since 2006. Linear regression of the time series shows an overall increase in temperature of 0.51°C with an annual increase of 0.028°C. Multi linear regressions on Mean Max and Min show minimum temperatures (0.56°C, 0.031°C/yr) have a greater increase overall and annually than max temperatures(0.48°C, 0.026°C/yr). This reef shows seasonal changes in early January and late October with peak warm and cold temperatures in September and February respectively. Power spectral denstiy of the site on the time series and during seasons shows most effective changes to thermal variability occur on long annual timescales, however there are peaks on diurnal and semi-diurnal scales. Effects from internal waves are present but show minimal reduction in temperature (0.11°C average).

# Section 2 - Generating plots

After organizing the profiles by their ids and making sure they are identified by down and upcasts, multiple profiles can be plotted along with the temperature and salinity contour plots over time.
