# **Introduction**

Coral reefs are integral ecosystems, each with their own set of diverse and endemic organisms. The coral reefs of the Virgin Islands vary in size and depth extending down to the mesophotic range, aprroximately 30 to 150m. These shallow and mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) are exposed to annual, seasonal, and dirunal variations in oceanographic variables (temperature, salinity, nutrients etc). This thesis will explore and characterize the oceanographic changes on the reefs, as well as investigate the effects from offshore internal waves.


## **Section 1 - Site Characterization**
There are several sites across the US Virgin Islands used in this study. These sites were chosen from those used in the Territorial Coral Reef Monitoring Project (TCRMP), with data coming from annual deployments of HOBO Pro V2 Water Temperature Loggers. Missing data gaps were filled using data from NPS deployments at the same site (Reference better).

## Black Point
Latitude: 18.3445  
Longitude: -64.98595  
Depth: 9 meters  

Characterization: Black Point is a shallow Orbicella-dominated reef located just offshore from the University of the Virgin Islands, St. Thomas. Temperature monitoring at this site has been conducted annually since 2006. Linear regression of the long-term time series indicates an overall warming of 0.51 °C, corresponding to an average annual increase of 0.028 °C yr⁻¹.  Multiple linear regression analyses of mean maximum and minimum temperatures reveal that minimum temperatures exhibit greater long-term and annual increases (0.56 °C total; 0.031 °C yr⁻¹) compared to maximum temperatures (0.48 °C total; 0.026 °C yr⁻¹). Seasonal variability is evident, with transitions occurring in early January and late October. Peak warm conditions are typically observed in September, while the coldest temperatures occur in February. Power spectral density analysis of the time series demonstrates that the dominant contributions to thermal variability occur on long, annual timescales, with secondary peaks at diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies. Internal wave activity is detectable but contributes only minimal cooling, with an average reduction of 0.11 °C.

## Botany Bay
Latitude: 18.35738
Longitude: -65.03442
Depth: 8 meters

Characterization: Botany Bay is a shallow reef located on northside of St. Thomas. Temperature collection at the site has occurred at the site from 2006 to 2024 with minor gaps between 06 and 07. However, this site shows inter annual and seasonal variability. Linear fits show an increase in temperature of 0.24°C with maximum and minimum temperatures rising 0.63°C and 0.62°C respectively. Peak minimum and maximum temperatures occur in March and September respectively. Site most effected by annual changes but power shows peaks on diurnal and semi-diurnal timescales. Effects from internal waves are minimal with only 0.07°C reduction on average.

## Brewers Bay
Depth: 6 meters
Latitude: 18.34403
Longitude: -64.98435


Characterization: Brewers Bay is a high cover orbicella annularis reef near UVI, with annual monitoring dating from 2018-2024. Temperature regressions show an overall increase of 1.22°C (0.203/yr) with max temperatures rising more than minimums at 1.25°C (0.208/yr) and 1.21°C (0.201/yr) respectively. This site experiences peak cold and warm seasons in February and September and shows peaks on semi-diurnal scales but is more influenced by annual changes. Internal waves do exhibit an effect on the reef, however it is very minor with and average temperature reduction of 0.10°C.
