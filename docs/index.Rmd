# **Introduction**

Coral reefs are integral ecosystems, each with their own set of diverse and endemic organisms. The coral reefs of the Virgin Islands vary in size and depth extending down to the mesophotic range, aprroximately 30 to 150m. These shallow and mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) are exposed to annual, seasonal, and dirunal variations in oceanographic variables (temperature, salinity, nutrients etc). This thesis will explore and characterize the oceanographic changes on the reefs, as well as investigate the effects from offshore internal waves.


## **Section 1 - Site Characterization**
There are several sites across the US Virgin Islands used in this study. These sites were chosen from those used in the Territorial Coral Reef Monitoring Project (TCRMP), with data coming from annual deployments of HOBO Pro V2 Water Temperature Loggers. Missing data gaps were filled using data from NPS deployments at the same site (Reference better).

# Section 2 - Generating plots

After organizing the profiles by their ids and making sure they are identified by down and upcasts, multiple profiles can be plotted along with the temperature and salinity contour plots over time.
